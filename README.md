# Aydens-Corner-Demo-Day

A Demo Day project presents: Ayden's Corner. This app has several features including a learning games and applications for toddlers, card matching games, animal sounds and spanish translation. 

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

My learning was focused on the manipulation of date objects. A learning application was the perfect oppurtunity to practice conversion between Spanish translation and english.

## Optimizations

Adding the api functionality to the project completely changed the application functionality and allowed me to add spanish translation. 

## Lessons Learned:

Speech Api was troublesome. It took a couple tries to get it right and I eventually created an array to finish up the app. I would have loved to get all of the API to work how I expected them.
